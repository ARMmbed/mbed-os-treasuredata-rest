## Intro
This is a library that wraps the [mbed-http](https://os.mbed.com/teams/sandbox/code/http-example/) library with specific syntax for the Treasure Data REST API. 

## More Info

## How does it work?
The library lets you specify your Treasure Data API key, the Database and Table you want to send data to. You then give the library a json formatted string and the library sends it off to treasure data. That simple.
